# News-Summarization

Text summarization in NLP is the process of summarizing the information in large texts for quicker consumption. In this notebook, I will walk you through the traditional extractive as well as the advanced generative methods to implement News summarization.

When you open news sites, do you just start reading every news article? Probably not. We typically glance the short news summary and then read more details if interested. Short, informative summaries of the news is now everywhere like magazines, news aggregator apps, research sites, etc. It is essential for the summary to be a fluent, continuous and depict the significant.

Text summarization methods can be grouped into two main categories:
 - Extractive
 - Abstractive
