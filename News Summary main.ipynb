       "'There won’t be a chill down to your bones this Halloween in Orlando, unless you count the sweat dripping from your armpits.\\nHalloween temperatures are supposed to come near or tie the record for the hottest Halloween in Orlando, but the month of October has already beaten the record for the hottest October ever recorded in the City Beautiful, according to the National Weather Service.\\nThe record to beat was an average of 80.2 degrees; with two days remaining 2019′s October is on track to record 80.9 degrees, said NWS meteorologist Derrick Weitlich.\\n“Yeah with just two days left, there’s no way it won’t break the record. This October has been above normal,” Weitlich said.\\nDaytona and Vero Beach are also expected to hit record breaking months.\\nSo why is it so hot? Was Central Florida cursed by a coven of witches?\\nThe answer is less magical and more meteorological as a ridge, or an area of blocking high pressure, has been sitting over Florida preventing frontal passages of cooler air from entering, Weitlich said.\\n“That’s been the trend this month,” he said. “So while the Central U.S. gets colder temperatures, we’re getting warmer than normal.”\\nThe hottest Halloween on record came in 1992 when pumpkins wilted in the heat of 90 degrees. This Halloween is expected to hit a temperature of 89 degrees, but the possibility for hotter temperatures does exist, Weitlich said.\\nThis week’s forecast isn’t all heat though.\\nCooler temperatures are expected to start this weekend where the high is forecast to be in the upper 70s, and the low could be in the low 70s by Saturday morning.\\nSaturday night should see lows in the mid 60s, Weitlich said.\\nBut temperatures are expected to return to the 80s by Monday.\\n“We’ll get, at least, a taste of fall,” Weitlich said.'"
